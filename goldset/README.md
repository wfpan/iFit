Note that in the literature, there are two systems where the #KC values might be different across different studies, i.e., Ant and jMeter. In our manuscript, the gold sets of projects Ant and jMeter come from Ref. [1], and the gold sets of other four projects come from Ref. [2]. The main rationale is Ref. [1] is the first work to use Ant and jMeter as subjects, and Ref. [2] is the first work to use other four projects.
